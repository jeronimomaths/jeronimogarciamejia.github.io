This is the Sage code used to compute the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology with trivial coefficients of the non-Carnot graded central products of low-dimension in [our paper](https://jeronimomaths.github.io/publications/)  with [G. Pallier](https://pallier.org/gabriel/) and C. [Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html).
