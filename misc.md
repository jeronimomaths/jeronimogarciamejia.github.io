This is the Sage code, written by [Gabriel Pallier](https://pallier.org/gabriel/), that we used in [our paper](https://jeronimomaths.github.io/publications/) together with Claudio Llosa Isenrich to compute the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology with trivial coefficients of the non-Carnot graded central products of low-dimension.
