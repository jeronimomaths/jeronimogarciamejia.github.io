You can download <a href="/cohomology.py">here</a> the Sage code used to compute the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology with trivial coefficients of certain central products in [On Dehn functions of central products of nilpotent groups](https://jeronimomaths.github.io/publications/)  with [G. Pallier](https://pallier.org/gabriel/) and [C. Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html).
