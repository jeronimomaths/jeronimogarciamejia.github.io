I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford, working in [Ric Wade](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/wade/index.html#)'s team.

In September 2024, I completed my PhD at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany under the supervision of [Claudio Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html). In 2020 I completed my Master's at the University of Bonn under the supervision of [Ursula Hamenstädt](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ursula/). Before that I obtained my Bachelor's at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

My research is on geometric group theory. In particular, I am interested in ideas involving combinatorial algebra, topology, and geometry for the study of infinite groups. My work includes exploring topics such as filling functions of groups —specifically their Dehn functions—, the large scale geometry of nilpotent groups, and the automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups.
