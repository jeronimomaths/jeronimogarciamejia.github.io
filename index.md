I am moving to Oxford this fall. I will be a postdoctoral research associate in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford. I will be working in [Ric Wade](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/wade/index.html#)'s team.

In September 2024, I completed my PhD at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany under the supervision of [Claudio Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html). In 2020 I completed my Master's at the University of Bonn under the supervision of [Ursula Hamenst√§dt](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ursula/). <!--Before that, in 2018, I obtained my Bachelor's at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) under the supervision of Carlos Prieto.-->

My research is in geometric group theory. I am mainly interested in the asymptotic geometry of non-positive curved groups and other interesting classes of groups such as nilpotent groups. In particular, I have spent some time thinking about filling functions and finiteness properties of groups.

Here is my <a href="CV_GarciaMejia.pdf">CV</a>.
