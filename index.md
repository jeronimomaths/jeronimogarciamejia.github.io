I am a third year PhD student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany under the supervision of [Claudio Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html). I expect to obtain my PhD in the summer of 2024. 

Before that I completed my Master's at the University of Bonn under the supervision of [Ursula Hamenst√§dt](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ursula/). Even before that, I completed my Bachelor's at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) under the supervision of [Carlos Prieto](https://paginas.matem.unam.mx/cprieto/). 

Broadly my research is in geometric group theory. I am mainly interested in the asymptotic geometry of none-positive curved groups. In particular, I have spent some time thinking about one important quasi-isometric invariant, namely the Dehn function of a finitely presented group.
